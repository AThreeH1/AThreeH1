### Hi there, let's start with an introduction, shall we?
I'm Abhijeet Avhale, and somehow, curiosity led me to pursue a major in Physics, and the idea of generalizing equations led me to applied mathematics(AI/ML) - Time Series - Finance, though all seemingly contrary.\
Education: Master's in Physics at NIT Surat 2025.\
Self-Pursuing Data Science and applied mathematics since 2021.

Quantitatively speaking, I have experience of: \
4 Years - Data Science \
8 Months - Financial Research Analyst \
1 Year - 3D Modelling and Prototyping. 


Other than that, Non professionally, I enjoy swimming, dancing, hypothesizing weird quantum immortality theorems or continuous chain universes, and the list goes on.
