### Hi there, Let's start with an introduction, shall we?
I'm Abhijeet Avhale and, somehow, curiosity led me to pursue Majors in Physics and the idea of generalizing equations led me to Finance, though both seemingly contrary.
Pursuing Master's in Physics at NIT Surat since 2020
Pursuing Finance (Fundamental, Quantitative, and Corporate) through online courses since 2020.

Quantitatively speaking, I have experience of:
2 Years - Data Science
8 Months - Financial Research Analyst
1 Year - 3D Modelling, Prototyping, Graphic Designing.


Other than that, Non professionally, I enjoy swimming, dance, hypothesizing weird quantum immortality theorems or continuous chain universes, and the list goes on.

Send me a message to collaborate or to ask any questions!
